# gb_merkle_trees

An Erlang library that provides a dictionary-like storage for binaries using general balanced binary Merkle trees, with an interface similar to `gb_trees`.

This library uses [semantic versioning 2.0](http://semver.org/). If a change causes different root hashes to be generated for the same input data when entering or deleting, it is considered backwards incompatible.

[erlang.mk](https://erlang.mk/) is used as a build tool.

## Documentation

Run `make edoc` and open `doc/index.html`.

## Contributing

Unless you’re deleting code or making pure optimizations, write tests. Except for basic cases, testing of this library is done using [triq](https://github.com/triqng/triq). To run tests, execute `make tests`.

Write function specifications. To run Dialyzer, execute `make dialyzer`.

No hard line length limit is imposed.
